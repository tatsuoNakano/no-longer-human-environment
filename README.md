# NO-LONGER-HUMAN-ENVIRONMENT

A strict TypeScript development environment optimized for AI-assisted coding with zero boilerplate logic.

## Overview
This repository provides a pre-configured environment with extreme linting and testing rules. It is designed to ensure that code generated by LLMs (Large Language Models) remains modular, testable, and maintainable by physically restricting code complexity.

## Key Features
- **Strict Static Analysis**: ESLint rules to prevent deep nesting and oversized functions.
- **Total Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript configuration to eliminate `any` and implicit types.
- **Automated Validation**: Pre-commit hooks via Husky and lint-staged to prevent non-compliant commits.
- **Test-Ready**: Pre-configured Jest environment for immediate TDD implementation.

## Architectural Constraints
Defined in `.eslintrc.json` and `tsconfig.json`:
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Max 3 (Forces modular logic)
- **Function Length**: Max 20 lines (Ensures single responsibility)
- **Parameters**: Max 2 per function (Encourages object-based interfaces)
- **Strict Null Checks**: Enabled by default

## Disclaimer
This is an experimental environment designed to test the limits of AI-driven, high-constraint development.
The practicality of these rules is currently under evaluation through real-world implementation.
